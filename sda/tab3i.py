            Details on the 3d dust map reconstruction are given in 
            [Lallement et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01627) and [Vergely et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09087)

            #### Available 3d dust extinction maps 

            Extent of the map is the distance from the center (Sun) to the edge of the map (in the galactic plane).
            For all cubes the height is 400 pc above and below the galactic plane.

            ##### Lallement et al. (2022)

            **Highest resolution**

            This 3d map is recommended for users interested in detailed structures in the galactic 
            dust distribution relative close to the Sun.

            * Extent: 3 kpc
            * Sampling: 10 pc
            * Resolution: 25 pc
            * Size: 6 x 6 x 0.8 kpc

            **Largest distance**

            This 3d map is recommend for users interested primarily in larger structures in the 
            galactic dust distribution traced to further distances from the Sun.

            * Extent: 5 kpc
            * Sampling: 20 pc
            * Resolution: 50 pc
            * Size: 10 x 10 x 0.8 kpc

            ##### Vergely et al. (2022)

            **Highest resolution - smallest extent**

            * Extent: 1.5 kpc
            * Sampling: 5 pc
            * Resolution: 10 pc
            * Size: 3 x 3 x 0.8 kpc

            **Medium resolution - medium extent**

            * Extent: 3 kpc
            * Sampling: 10 pc
            * Resolution: 25 pc
            * Size: 6 x 6 x 0.8 kpc

            **Lowest resolution - largest extent**

            * Extent: 5 kpc
            * Sampling: 20 pc

            #### 1D distance-extinction density

            ##### Single target 1d profiles

            You can enter either sky coordinates (equatorial or galactic) or the target name 
            (resolved with CDS/Simbad) to retrieve line-of-sight differential extinction-distance 
            and cumulative extinction-distance curves.
            You can also provide a distance for a marker to be put in the plots.

            ##### Bulk upload 1d profiles

            Target input file (CSV) can be a list of target names (resolved with Simbad) or 
            equatorial/galactic (decimal notation) coordinates.

            #### 2D planar extinction density maps

            ##### Tips

            For horizontal maps, if increasing longitudes are not in the right sense then the solution
            is to map again using an opposite latitude for the vector perpendicular to the image.

            In case the view is not correct (e.g., view from above or below for maps parallel to the plane) 
            try to invert the perpendicular. For the map parallel to the plane this will change 
            the view from above or below.
            
            #### Export results

            1d profiles and 2d maps can be exported as CSV files.

            ##### 1D export
            
            For each input target the ouput CSV will contain 3 columns: distance, extinction, cumulative extinction

            ##### 2D export

            The 2D export CSV file contains 3 columns: X, Y, Z, where X and Y form the 2d plane and Z gives 
            the log10 extinction value in the XY-plane.
